# üß© Java Lambdas Practice

## üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement

Exclusive practice focused on the use of **Lambdas and Streams in Java 8+**, a fundamental concept for functional programming in Java.  
The goal is to understand and apply lambdas in different contexts through a series of progressive exercises.

### Level 1

1. **Exercise 1:**  
   From a list of strings, write a method that returns a list containing all strings that include the letter `'o'`. Print the result.

2. **Exercise 2:**  
   Do the same as above, but the method must also return only the strings that contain `'o'` and have more than 5 characters. Print the result.

3. **Exercise 3:**  
   Create a list with the names of the months of the year. Print all the elements of the list using a lambda expression.

4. **Exercise 4:**  
   Repeat the previous exercise, but print the list using a **method reference**.

5. **Exercise 5:**  
   Create a **Functional Interface** with a method called `getPiValue()` that must return a `double`.  
   From the `main()` method, instantiate the interface with a lambda that returns `3.1415`. Invoke the `getPiValue()` method and print the result.

6. **Exercise 6:**  
   Create a list with numbers and strings and sort the list from the shortest string to the longest.

7. **Exercise 7:**  
   Using the same list, sort it in reverse ‚Äî from the longest string to the shortest.

8. **Exercise 8:**  
   Create a **Functional Interface** containing a method called `reverse()`. This method must receive and return a `String`.  
   In the main class, inject the implementation of the interface using a lambda so that it returns the input string reversed.  
   Invoke the interface instance, pass a string, and verify that the result is correct.

### Level 2

Additional exercises to continue practicing advanced use of **Lambdas and Streams**.
